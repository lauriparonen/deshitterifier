# deshitterifier (WIP)

browser extension that hides engagement metrics, timestamps and blue checks on [twitter/X](https://x.com) - focus on the signal, not the noise

also replaces the default font with a monospace one

### Caveat
Given how Elon has chosen to be as hostile as possible towards anyone wanting to utilize his platform with creativity, this version is still somewhat clunky: The CSS class names are dynamically generated so the script relies on aria labels, and the number metrics aren't hidden in every view (such as in image modals). The styles are also injected only after the first scroll.

local use:
1. clone the repo
2. enable developer mode in Chrome
3. load the extension pack in chrome://extensions
4. enjoy a more signal-heavy Twitter	(｡•̀ᴗ-)✧
